## üìùContribution Guidelines


Welcome to [DSA-4-ALL](https://github.com/ayu8/DSA-4-ALL).
First of all thanks for taking time out to contribute :smiley: :partying_face:


## üíªBefore Contributing


Before sending your pull requests, make sure that you **read the guidelines** properly.
If you still have any doubt about the contributing guide, please feel free to reach out.


## üôåContribution


You can provide solutions to any problem of DSA, in any programming language of your choice (like C++, Java, Python, etc).
You **also need to provide the link of the question**, from any coding platform (like LeetCode, GeeksForGeeks-Practice, InterviewBit, etc.)


### üîñSteps to Contribute

Following are the steps to guide you. You can proceed in 2 ways: either by local machine (using git) or using github only.

***Using GitHub***

* Step 1: Star and Fork the repo. Now you can proceed in 2 ways: either by local machine (using git) or using github only.
* Step 2: Open the forked repo (can find in your repositories) and open the folder of your desired topic.
* Step 3: Find ```Add File``` dropdown-option and click on ```Create new file``` or ```Upload Files``` (if you already have file saved in your local machine).

* Step 4: Name of the file should be in the snake_case convention with proper file extension, for example: ```search_in_a_2d_matrix.py``` or ```search_in_a_2d_matrix.cpp```, etc. Also, mention the question link (in comments), for example:

* Step 5: Add the file and then commit changes.
* Step 6: Come to your forked DSA-4-ALL repo. You will see a msg like, *this repo is 1 commit ahead of ayu8:main*. Click on this and in the next page, click on ```Create pull request```


***Local Machine***

* Step 1: Star and Fork the repo. Now you can proceed in 2 ways: either by local machine (using git) or using github only.
* Step 2: Go to your Git terminal and clone it on your machine.
```
    git clone https://github.com/ayu8/DSA-4-ALL.git
```
* Step 3: Go to your desired topic, using ```cd DSA-4-ALL/<topic-name>``` and create a new file with name in the snake_case convention with proper file extension.
          for example: ```search_in_a_2d_matrix.py'``` or ```search_in_a_2d_matrix.cpp```, etc.
