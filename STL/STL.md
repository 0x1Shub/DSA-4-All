# STL

STL stands for standard template Library. This is a library containing Containers,Algorithms,Interators and Functors.

## Containers
Containers are the class which supports template with methods and properties. Containers are not the data-structures but are using certain data-structure because of 
which they are often interpreted with Data-structures.

example: vector is a container using array data structure. vector is often interpreted by dynamic array.

## Algorithms
Algorithms are the functions which are there to make things easy for the user, these are the functions whose functionality often used by the user as part of algorithms.
example: **sorting** (algorithm) -> **sort**( function in STL) , **maximum element** (algorithm) -> **max**( function in STL ),etc.


## Functors:
Functors are the classes which acts as a function.


## Iterators
Iterators the elements supported by STL used for iteration in containers.
example: ***vector<__> iterator:: it;***
this is how we declare iterator for vector similarly we can declare for other containers.
